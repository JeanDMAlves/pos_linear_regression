# pos_linear_regression

Using the Income1.csv dataset, perform a linear regression of the Income variable (y - estimate value) from the Education variable (x - feature) using the matrix formulation of the least squares method (Lec.1 - slide 30).

Present the results in a mini-report in PDF format, showing: 1) a graph showing the 30 points of the dataset together with the result of the linear regression in the form of the line y=wx; 2) the mean square error (MSE) curve as a function of the value of w (see example of results on Lec.1 - slide 31).

The implemented code (or a link to the code, e.g., Google Colab) in Python using Numpy (see the Numpy library tutorial in the references) must be included in the report. Do not forget to grant access to the shared link.
